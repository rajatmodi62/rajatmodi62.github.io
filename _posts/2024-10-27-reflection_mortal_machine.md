>> Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind. - Albert Einstein. 

A lot of people don't believe in God. Some do. Some believe there is no God, but do believe that there is something greater than themselves in this world. They cannot quite put their word to what  it is, but an abstract entity they can feel sometimes is with them. Some say its like some ether which always surrounds them. Some people think of themselves as gods: they believe that there is nothing in this world greater than them. As they face their last moments in this world: they realize that they have been too late to notice, and they could have lived their lives just a little bit better. And some people dont care about that at all. They leave a legacy or a body of work behind, only to realize that the world does not care: it keeps going on. 

But, no matter what the belief, i have seen people brought to their knees, at least one time in their whole life. Even if they are the richest men, most beautiful, or most poweful, these things dont last forever, for birth, death, old age and disease are cruel. They force us to bend the knee whether physically or in our heads. If this is the reality of the material nature that we live in, then what gives us the purpose to keep living? What prevents us from being in an everlasting state of fear: that even if things are going good now, they wont turn bad later? Or that if they are bad now, perhaps there is happiness waiting for us all just in the corner, and that all we need is just a little bit of patience before giving up? 

What fills the empty holes in our heart: those pangs of loneliness which hit us when we move out of our parents home, lose our partners, and realize that we have a bigger hole left to fill that what we started with? Life is funny: We spend time with our families, wishing to be more independent and more accomplished. And when we become more accomplished, we realize we have no family left at all: our achievements have become mere papers, and no one left to share with. Money seems to have lost joy: it just becomes a number in the bank account, and no matter where we spend it, we still feel more despaired.  

Surely, there is some higher source of inspiration, something which more everlasting, something which cannot be a mere product of external validation. Millions can be stupid but surely billions in the world can't: they bow over their faith and seek blessings. And they find a purpose to live, something which helps them in the daily grind of their work, something which makes their life just a little bit easier. Muslims pray so many times a day, hindus go to temples, buddhists meditate, 

We cannot help ourselves but notice how the mere act of getting on the floor from our chairs, lowering ourselves physically, kindling our egos, helps us feel just a little bit better. Spanning from the lowest earth which is a mere part of the cosmos to the highest level that is the whole cosmos, we can find different ways to pray. For eg,
