Next, we are still on the floor, but see the sun through a window of our homes. That makes us remember that there are still untamed elements better than us in this world.

We step out of our home and are filled by the lightness all around. We feel the warmth of the cosmos in our bones.

</div>
We gaze up at the sky and see the cosmos. There are countless stars in the sky. Our parents who passed away, still watch over us.
