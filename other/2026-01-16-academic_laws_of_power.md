Some academic laws of power. This only holds for the tech industry:

- Praise in Public, Criticize in private: Never, criticize someone in public. They will grow to hate you. The moment they find a better ship, they shall jump. 
- Bond over non-technical stuff: Technical tastes change over time. People drift apart. Everlasting friendships are forged on common-things: be it tragedies, or success. A higher purpose, for eg, god, or a "technical-mission" disguised as spiritual builds company-culture. Support people in their tough times, but don't act as a `sounding-board' for all their troubles: it impacts your own positivity.
- Skills can be taught, not character: Work with people who have good character, who: 1) take responsibility 2) stay loyal 3) have your back if things grow hard. Skills can be learnt/taught over time. 
- Don't flaunt success: Don't post successes on social-media. Let results speak over mere words. Stay wary of `the achievement loop': most people validate superficial things. More people validating shitty work boosts dopamine. You end up doing shitty work yourself. 
- Validation of architects > other people: Validation from a person who actually "invented" the thing what you care about, is better than validation from millions of people who lack depth. 
- Defend your team vigorously: Stand up for the people in your team. Take their blame on yourself. Give them credit. This builds loyalty. Just make sure, that they know when you stood out for them, so that they don't mistake "loyalty" for weakness of character. 
- Trust is the highest form of currency: Trust > money. Billion dollar companies are formed on ideas which haven't panned out. Stealth work needs trust. Hire those who you can trust, not those who are technically most qualified. They should not grow to take you for guaranteed.
- Keep circle of trust small: Those you implicitly trust should not number more than 2-3. They hold the keys to your future endeavour. Offer them partnership, instead of salary. If you lose them, you have lost your future. 
- Intellectual simulation > money: For those who are brilliant, they have a tendency to get bored. They get stuck in the money loop: they are paid more than the entire industry, so that they 'cannot switch', but not a penny more. That's where they quit to spin off their own things. If someone pays them more, they flit, for they have no loyalty. Key to retention of such talent is "martyrdom": they must be led to believe that they are working on a noble-cause, something that persists after they pass away. For nothing can outlast time, old age and death. 
- Tech> Non Tech: Those who work on fundamental things carry the ultimate currency. Protect them for such minds seed new paradigms, which fuels new businesses. Non tech/scaling stack can always be built. Not good people. -->
