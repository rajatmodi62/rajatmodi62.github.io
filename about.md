> I was jack of all, master of none. Yet, I dared do a PhD. For what is PhD, but philosophy. And philosophy i did. Turned out i was still jack all along.  

I am currently pursuing PhD in computer science at University of Central Florida. I am being advised by [Dr. Yogesh Rawat](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=D_JvEcwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Mubarak Shah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p8gsO3gAAAAJ&hl=en). I worked as Senior Member of Technical staff at Athena Health. Previously I worked at Samsung Research under [Dr. Manish Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sIYrRw0AAAAJ). In my earlier life, I spent time at IIT Roorkee, Parimal Lab, under Dr. [Partha Pratim Roy](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=moDpyKkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). During my undergrad at NSIT, I was fortunate enough to have worked and learnt from [Dr. Harish Parthasarathy](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=hdt6eVoAAAAJ&hl=en). I spent time discussing quantum computing, and various mathematical problems with [Dr. K.R. Parthasarathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._R._Parthasarathy_(probabilist)). And of course, i cannot forget chai/samosa in  college canteen. Last, but not the least,  i had the great privilege of learning flute from my Guru [Rajendra Prasanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Prasanna). 

The purpose of this website is for me to 'think' about analogies from a brain point of view and use those notions towards developing an intelligent machine. Computational models of intelligence shall keep coming and going. Fundamental principles of perception however shall remain same. I seek to uncover those. 

 I try to read diverse fields and understand how brain "might" work. Then, i build computational models encoding those mental constraints. My research delves into efficient-learning, part-whole hierarchies in neural nets, machine perception, binding problem, and simulating cognitive thought processes.
