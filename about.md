I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at University of Central Florida. I am being advised by [Dr. Yogesh Rawat](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=D_JvEcwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Mubarak Shah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p8gsO3gAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously I worked at Samsung Research under [Dr. Manish Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sIYrRw0AAAAJ). In my earlier days, I have spent time at IIT Roorkee, Parimal Lab, under Dr. [Partha Pratim Roy](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=moDpyKkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). During my undergrad, I was fortunate enough to have worked and learnt from [Dr. Harish Parthasarathy.](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=hdt6eVoAAAAJ&hl=en).

My focus is on action recognition. Specifically, how can a machine learn to distinguish between an actor, object of action and actions being performed. Another direction i am interested in is understanding the 'supporting actors' in videos which can inform inference of an action.
