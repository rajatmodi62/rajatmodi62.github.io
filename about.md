I am currently pursuing PhD in computer science at University of Central Florida. I am being advised by [Dr. Yogesh Rawat](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=D_JvEcwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Mubarak Shah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p8gsO3gAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to my PhD, I worked as Senior Member of Technical staff at Athena Health. Before that, I worked at Samsung Research under [Dr. Manish Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sIYrRw0AAAAJ). In an earlier life, I spent time at IIT Roorkee, Parimal Lab, under Dr. [Partha Pratim Roy](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=moDpyKkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). During my undergrad at NSIT, I was fortunate enough to have worked and learnt from [Dr. Harish Parthasarathy](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=hdt6eVoAAAAJ&hl=en). I will forever cherish the time spent discussing quantum computing, and various mathematical problems with [Dr. K.R. Parthasarathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._R._Parthasarathy_(probabilist)). Last, but not the least,  i had the great privilege of learning flute from my Guru [Rajendra Prasanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Prasanna). 

##  Research Interests 

For a long time, i described myself as being interested on LLMs, transformers, efficient AI, learning efficient models which can adapt under "distribution shifts".  

From an industry standpoint: I am interested in deploying AI models "on the edge", specifically techniques like weight pruning, quantization etc. I am also searching for a way to transfer knowledge in a zero-shot way between architectures of different structures. 

From a research standpoint: Now, i am just trying to figure out how the brain "might" work. I read neuroscience, and then build computational models encoding those constraints. My interest lies on building biological plausible learning algorithms, simulating cognitive thought processes, inventing new kinds of "associative" memories. More specfically, i am interested in lifelong learning, i.e. how to build machines which learn even during [inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04620) and do not rely on pre-defined SSL tasks.

Some questions which excite me: 1) what is [next](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04156) after backpropagation 2) How to [encode part-whole hierarchies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12627) in neural nets 3) How to solve the ["binding problem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_problem) in neural nets 4) How to build machines which can solve optical illusions like [Necker's cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necker_cube), [Kaninza Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_contour), and [Spinning Dancing Lady.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_dancer) 5) Build quantum [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Arnold_representation_theorem) neural nets 6) Mechanisms of sleep in brain, and [its role](https://www.nature.com/articles/304111a0) in memory storage 7) Fast-weights to [store](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06258) temporary neural activities 8) How to  solve [hard problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) of consciousness. 9) How to invent memories which don;t generate neural activity at all, or directly [compress](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/backpropandbrain.pdf) these activations as soon as they are generated. These problems [taste](https://colah.github.io/notes/taste/) good to me :-).  


The challenge then is which one to solve first. Now that i hold these problems in mind, i keep looking for cool tools which will enable solving them. And as soon as something appears, i drop all i am doing, and get back to solving it.
